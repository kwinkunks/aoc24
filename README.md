No frills Python again this year.

## Week 1

- **Day 1: Historian Hysteria** — The 'hard to parse' style of 2023 is back, presumably to keep the chatbots away. Too bad because ChatGPT solves both parts correctly with no instruction (see [chatgpt/day01.py](./chatgpt/day01.py)). Much easier than last year's Day 1, this felt more like earlier years. SLOC: 19.
- **Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports** — Fun little problem with the derivative of an integer series. Part 2 can probably be done in a clever way (something something second derivative) but brute force suffices. SLOC: 16.

When counting SLOC, I don't include blank or comment lines.
